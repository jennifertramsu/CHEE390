function quicksort(v, l, r)
% v = 3D matrix
% This function will implement the quicksort algorithm on a 3D matrix of
% any dimension in 2 steps
% Step 1 = Sort the matric by rearranging the 2 planes such that the plane
% with the lowest sum of the diagonal elements is at the front

% QUESTIONS
% Diagonal elements --> only the first diagonal?
% What if plane is not square

% Step 2 = sort each plane
